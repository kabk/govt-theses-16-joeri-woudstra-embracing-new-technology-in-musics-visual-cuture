  <p> Music artist and art school graduate is mad with how the visual of music is not used to it's full potential with access to basically everything thanks to the post internet technological developments and shows how things can be different and why they should be.

  <div class="text"> It is an interesting time for music. With the shift of soundwaves turning into zeros and ones being behind us, the way of the visual presentation of music towards the consumer has done the same. This is not a surprise knowing the fact that our lives and our second lives in the digital realm are starting to overlap more then ever, now that we have reached the point where new generations are growing up in a fully digitalized world. Physical magazines stop the presses and continue their journalism on the web. But most of all has the emergence of social media created an interesting new platform for artists to digitally represent themselves. Media like facebook, snapchat, instagram, soundcloud, tumblr, youtube, twitter etc. have all created new stages for the artist to build a character and personality. Artists and musicians are becoming a factor that the user can relate itself to and define itself with within the digital realm. What is very important/interesting about these media is that they are all (very much and) almost completely visual. <br>

This is especially creating interesting developments for the placing of music in the context of social media. Obviously music is perceived sonically, but the perception can change a lot in relation to a visual context. The music is brought to the user through the screen. The screen functions as another layer of your existence actually replacing the one you are currently in, with the distractions of the real world. How does an artist gain the user's undivided attention, if at all. As Lev Manovich states in "The Language of New Media", the computer screen displays a number of coexisting windows, of which not a single completely dominates the viewer's attention. On social media the music presented through the screen is only a visual compartment, appealing the user to click the link to the actual music, adding even more distance between the music and receiver. With rapid technological changes like these in mind, I wonder. How does this alter the way music reaches us? How does this change the function of the music artwork? Interestingly enough we seem to be finding ourselves on the brink of a turning point in the visual representation of the music artist, both looking back and forward in time. To understand what is going to change hereon after we must first understand; how has the way the artist presents itself to its audience changed the last couple of years? <br><br>

<div class="chapter"> Oversaturation from the bedroom </div><br>

The digital revolution has caused production of music to turn completely digital. This means that any upper middle class kid with an internet connection and a torrent client can get into music production and will, instead of stocking shelves in the local supermarket. With the internet both enlarging audiences and helping give them direction for specific sounds, a lot of young emerging artists have gotten the opportunity to reach overnight success with their digital creations, in the form of 5 digit + number as their play and like count. The reach for attention on the digital platform has become a championship of some sort. The constant demand for positive digital feedback This has had two major consequences on the market:<br>

The music market is over saturated
An illusion is created where there is no room left for a new artist to create his/her own sound
Besides huge amounts of people trying to make it in the same business, within different subgroups, they're all making the same music. The internet has helped create an environment that seems to be giving new artists the illusion that there is no time and space left for creative exploration. In reality this is what should be the main thing that separates you from the masses. And even if you do, you end up running into the over saturation issue. <br>

To stick out in a new generation crowd of musicians screaming for views, likes and shares, apparently you have to be appealing on another level besides being so sonically. There has to be another factor that makes it appealing to engage with you, before the screen presents the user a place where the user can interact with the music. As stated earlier, a new level has been added to the representation of the artist, which is the online presence or, again, absence.

Not only should the artist make good/appealing/progressive/interesting music, the way it is presented should trigger the user enough that he won't continue scrolling. Often it is even the case that the presentation is more appealing than the music in question but keeps the viewer interested. This is when the strength and deceiving nature but also the importance of the visual really comes to it's core.<br>

Is it because of this that people tend to grasp to the physical, or even the old? When music became digital and the Compact Disc became a mainstream medium you could clearly see a trend of people actively supporting and falling back on the vinyl. After the CD's disappeared and nothing but the digital files remained, you can again (or still?) see waves of people actively standing for vinyl as their ultimate medium, and for several reasons. A lot of people would agree with the fact that the deep sound of the bass on a vinyl is of higher quality and the warmness of the needle touching the vinyl must give some sort of feeling of nostalgia to some listeners. But is there nothing more to it? Maybe the fact that the physicalness of an album you can hold and place in your room, something you can perceive physically and not only sonically, gives an extra layer to the idea of the music. <br>

If the digital platform is the future of our visual culture to come then why are all digi artworks still mimicking the vinyl packaging in it's square shape? Surely it's not because of the fact that instagram would only let you upload square pictures until recently. Perhaps the square record had become a formality in music culture and just like any physicallity turned digital (apple and skeumorphism example or maybe even windows mediaplayer mimicking an oldschool radio) it stuck, in a very subtle way, to the visual standard of skeuomorphism used in interface design. Now that Jonathan Ive however made sure that every last bit of skeuomorphism has been beaten "flat" (and of course the rest of the companies followed) would you not say it's time that the digital records sleeve takes on a new shape? It would be a waste of possibilities if it didn't.<br><br>

<div class="chapter"> Music loses shape </div><br>

"In an ancient past graphic design and music used to be very close. Album covers and far reaching projects with artist-performers would take the designer out of a boring deadlock of annual reports and corporate identities. The invention of independent pop music was the invention of another type of design. Now once again there is a closeness between both worlds but they have changed. Music has become an art form that is also one of the world's most exciting emotional currencies and design has become so fluid as to invade every field, wanted or unwanted, in search for meaning."<br>

This ancient past Daniel speaks of must definitely be around the year 1939 when the first albumcover ever was designed by Alex Steinweiss, art director and graphic designer at Columbia Records, commencing the first promotionally  visual era in music ever. These were much simpler times in terms of artist representation, or music in general for that matter. By the time, the phonograph disc had been in the running for quite some time and it wouldn't be that long (9 years) before the first vinyl would have been introduced to the world. What is of big importance for this period of time in music is that it was, especially compared to now, much more a performative medium. As most people know, musical reproductions in the form of discs at that time weren't of a quality that would properly replicate the original recording of a song. Therefore to properly experience the music you wanted to hear you would have to go out to an event and see the band, or cover band (an actual thing still around that time), making music itself dominantly performative. Obviously before that time the only role the visual had in extent to its musician was to promote actual performances rather than getting the audience to buy records. In a way the performance was the promotion, or even the visual.<br>

And even after, around the 60s, when the record industry was literally transformed because of the LP sales and the business that it had created over time, the only way to get any feeling of interaction with a musician was through actual concerts. There was literally no choice for both the artist and the audience, concerts were the standard and the performer had to do the shows to sell the records. However in the 70s an early form of something that is becoming the standard in obtaining music in current times pops up. Cassette tapes have become a way to cheaply easily reproduce / illegally distribute popular music and show in such an early stage that, the more flexible the medium becomes the higher the chances become of it being pirated or being used to other ends than originally inteded to be for. The U.S. Congess declares sound recordings worthy of copyright protection in passing the 1971 Sound Recording Amendment to the 1909 Copyright Statute. Though this amendment is proposed largely in response to the record industry's complaints of vinyl bootlegging, the implications of the amendment are applied to the burgeoning recordable cassette market. The youth had been taping and swapping their favorite albums and the record industry advocate a tax on blank cassettes to make up for the lost revenue from tape bootlegging. At the time the music sales were still growing. Late 70s however when sales started dropping and the introduction of the walkman had turned the tape to a main format of music, piracy had become a real issue and an industry wide campaign against home taping had emerged.<br>

Ironically enough, the emergence of piracy within the industry introduces music for the first time in the digital format when Philips and Sony announce the Compact Disc. The CD heralds the temporary death of vinyl (until it's sudden revival in the contemporary digital age) and the emergence of the internet, which in 1990 combined, creating the mp3, appears to be the root of the state that music representation currently has gotten into. With the internet as an uprising platform in popular culture things like music streaming and online music distribution pops up which eventually leads to the ever ongoing fight against internet piracy, commencing in 1998 by the RIAA (Recording Industry Assosciation of America). In the search for making all of the music as much distributable and profitable as possible, the productional evolutions in music towards the contemporary times, seem to have done the opposite. Reproduction has become so easy that piracy seem to have gotten the overhand and made profit drop tremendously. This has caused a huge shift in the position of the musician, both economically as well as artistically. The records sales don't seem to be the leading figure in the industries income any more and instead of playing shows to sell records, it looks like the artist has to release records in order to do performances and concerts. This adds a new layer to the promotional hierarchy. As discussed earlier the artist is trying to find a way of online representation as a part of it's success. Where the performance was a promotional thing back then, the (social) media function as a promotional tool now creating interest for the records which leads to paying shows. It doesn't come as a surprise that a rising number of artists and labels decide to give away digital records for free in the shape of mixtapes (take a look at Datpiff.com on which basically all rap careers are born through successful free records). This is a way in which the industry admits or even surrenders to this idea of the record not being profitable anymore. A shift has taken place in music. Thanks to the digitizing of everything, music has become much more of a mediated medium rather than a performative one.<br><br>

<div class="chapter"> Analysis of social media </div><br>

"It's free and always will be". That's what it (for some reason still) says on the facebook sign up page. The intentions are always good initially. Facebook would become the platform to keep your network of friends and interests together in touch in one non physical "location". The timeline used to  show all of the activity of your interests activity summarized on your screen. Soon however posts would appear in your feed non-chronologically, sporadically and finally based on "your interest". Algorithms made it's entry and slowly with that came paid posts. Basically what this means is that if your post doesn't get enough interactions (comments / clicks / likes) within a small selection if your facebook friends in its first moments of its existence it won't show up in the rest of your friends' feed. And the same counts for artist pages and fans. Unless ofcourse, you sponsor your post; the more you pay the more it's shown on people's timelines. The idea is for your feed to only show good content, good content is however highly subjective which turns it into most liked content which basically means the content with the most attention or the content that is paid for the most. People always said regarding facebook and any social media platform for that matter; if you're not paying for it, you're the product. However you can now decide whether you want to pay facebook, which I guess makes you both a product as well as a consumer. We are now officially products of ourselves, thanks to social media. <br>

*Write about buying likes / Refer to artist group called share castle*<br>

But let's not drift away from the main subject in question too much, this doesn't mean that everything is doomed. In fact it should push us (the user) to be more creative with the content that we share. The thing is; as soon as you start paying for boosting your posts, facebook will change it's algorithms, making sure that the next post you don't boost will get even less exposure. As a result a lot of artists turn into meme pages, that share funny images to generate more audience before they even think of sharing music or like to download, which in it's turn turns their music into a currency for social media traffic. But there's more ways to get your music the right attention. The last two examples actually make your audience much more unfocused and unclear. Your fans might not even be fans of your discography and only follow you because you said something funny once or liked this one Aaliyah edit you posted on soundcloud because you didn't share any new sounds for like a week. Congratulations you're not an artist anymore, you're a meme. <br>

This doesn't mean that all the pages that are not meme musicians are interesting online presences though. Still, there's a pattern to be found in the way artists announce certain events of there musical career. The first and most important feature, one many seem to be taking as fact, is that it's on the web. The guidelines of the tool used on their turn create certain nearly pre-generated approaches to the artist's announcement. Whether it's Facebook or Twitter the artist (read: generic artist) seems to feel it's mandatory to come across extremely enthusiastic about the event or opportunity in question.<br> <br>


<div class="chapter"> Websites as locations </div><br>

You could look at the array of social platforms and blogs as being different "locations" that the regular internet user can quickly shift between during their daily time online. Something announced on twitter can get picked up by followers and blogs and can be spread in other places like facebook or soundcloud or any platform. It seems that people tend to limit themselves to the mainstream social media to get their work spread however. While a location (website) outside of these media is in no way subject to any limitations to the visual side of things, if any side. The dedicated website can create an almost immersive experience, be it informative, visual, audio/visual or even interactive. The website can just as any other media output (like a videoclip) be exciting enough to get picked up by third parties and be premiered by any big outlet. This is the big difference between a post and a website. <br>

Take for example Rustie's Green Language record, released through Warp in 2014, which was streamable online by engaging in a first person video game. Just like the music the game tends to create a virtual world curated by the musician in question. The further you get into the game the more songs you get to hear from the new record. It almost reaches a point where it's uncertain whether you're actually playing for the game or the music. Perhaps this is what is supposed to be achieved of the dedicated platform. Even though the visual (or virtual in this case) is a response to the audio primary, the audio/visual almost functions as a "gesamtkunstwerk" where the visual is equal to the audio. A virtual world in this sense means that it's just you, the game and the music, but some online platforms even take it as far as bringing actual physical locations together on digital space through streaming. <br>

The famous party streaming platform Boiler Room and streaming party platform SPF420 show two extreme examples of this. It's platforms like these that help define certain musical niches, almost in a way that forums in the earlier days of the internet used to bring people together to discuss about any interest they had. However in this case it is done by creating temporary live streams happening cross platform that gets the user to engage with both the music and live discussing it. Where Boiler Room streams from one location a time to their website online, a place where everyone can comment on the events happening at the physical party, SPF420 let's a lineup of artists spread over the world stream their show from their bedroom to a chatroom, creating an online club environment almost. A smaller project based in The Hague called Hyphae would even go as far as creating the last described concept and then project the whole thing in a club and invite people to enjoy the program in a physical space and streaming the actual crowd back to the artist as live feedback, blurring the lines between URL and IRL. Actually this is something that all contemporary technological developments (music related or not) seem to be heading it's course towards to. Take a look at Holly Herndon for example who in her shows connects the digital platform to the physical space, by creating live interactions between audience and visuals and adds facebook profiles of people attending the event in question to a three dimensional digital space projected behind the musical performance in collaboration with partner and conceptual artist Mat Dryhurst.<br>

Obviously platforms like Boiler Room are a big part of an underground club culture and like no others do they get the sense of certain "scenes" and how artists make their way online. No wonder that they have a few words to say about the current state of music in a post internet age. "The Internet has completely revitalised underground culture. The democratisation of access on a global scale has empowered musicians, freed information, started conversations, sparked incredible new levels of creativity, and put the jumper cables to an industry that was flatlining. It’s no longer pot luck for who you know or where you’re at; the 1% have been rendered irrelevant. Good music finally reaches the right people. It’s better now than at any point in history, and we’re on track for it to get better and better. We’re part of a privileged generation. Some see the Internet as a walled garden, where mastery of confusing new rules is required to stay afloat. We see the opposite: the barriers have been knocked down in every direction. The underground doesn’t just live online – it thrives there." <br><br>

<div class="chapter"> Post new media </div><br>

In the process of writing this text I had the chance to talk to the initiator of a new platform for music visualisation called Whitestone, twice actually. The first time was when the project was in it's recruiting stages. Through a friend of mine Roey Tsemah, the founder of the project, reached out to me if I would be interested to try out his new platform. Later I got the chance to talk to him about why I wasn't extremely excited to engage into this . Actually from the start I was sceptic about the whole thing. The website headlines "This is what music will look like in the future". Just the subject I'm writing about! Roey explained to me when we talked that Whitestone would become the youtube or vimeo of websites/experiences. Like a bunch of it's predecessors Whitestone seems to be aiming to reinvent the face of music all at once. Apple took it's shot back in 2009 when it launched iTunes LP, an extra iTunes feature that let's you create your own " rich, interactive experience" as your album artwork in iTunes. (Of course the fact that this was limited to iTunes already slowed down the process of taking over the music industry standards). Until recently popular music blog Pitchfork had their own platform called Pitchfork Advance that would play a yet to be released record alongsides fullscreen animations and delivered by the artist. In a way that isn't much different from Pitchfork sharing someone else's streaming website on it's blog, but the template is an interesting take on the all too well known music blog album premiere preview stream. For some reason when I started looking up Pitchfork Advance however I couldn't find anything about it. My search for a platforms approach to change the future of perceiving music ended up in something that was hidden, as if it never existed, or as if it knew that it wasn't really that new. If you think about it, a youtube for websites, in a way is really the internet itself. If you want to create/code an immersive experience, why not just make a self-serving website? And if it should be shared on social media, why not add a share button to that website? In this perspective Whitestone really is a Facebook that only let's you like music artists and instead of artist pages you have websites that become artist pages once you scroll down. <br><br>



<div class="chapter"> Performance as land art </div><br>

There's a fine line between how physical performances get its share of online publication and the way that Land Art can create certain waves in the digital sphere.<br>

Going back to music; a perfect example of locations lifting an event beyond the performance itself would be how Red Bull Music Academy New York organized a Tri-Angle Records showcase last year in an old Wall Street Vault in the former J.P. Morgan building. (http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/events/nyc-2015-triangle-records-5th-anniversary)<br><br>

<div class="chapter"> Conclusion </div><br>

*I plan on writing towards the conclusion in which I describe that in order to be progressive or engaging on a digital platform you actually have to step away from the platform or, in some cases, even better; the screen. This is also the reason I refer to Land Art. The work you present in the physical world always will find its way back to the digital world anyways, since the main use of social digital platforms is to share exciting enough real world stories to the social network you have achieved over time. The problem lays within the fact that 1; the representation of the artist starts on the platform itself, which makes it hard for the content to leave that context once placed there (I have a few nice references I can throw in here for example Aphex Twin and the promotion of his record which was just a blimp with his logo and a unpublished url on a TOR website). And two; the user is not being challenged. It seems that artists want to create an as easily accessible connection between the user and the thing they present, which is basically the main ingredient for dull content (kind of like clickbait websites).*<br>

*In the conclusion i refer to this text on the next step, how we need the performance and the screen to go beyond the performance and the screen. We don't need the screen to perform, but we shouldn't condemn it."<br><br>


<div class="chapter"> Abstract </div><br>

The visual side of music has always maintained a conventional character. LPs and CDs are round and in order to properly wrap them up the corresponding packaging is square, and with that the artwork too; nine out of ten time the artist finds itself performing his show at the end of the room lifted above the crowd and the video always seems tied to the design and visual context that Youtube or Vimeo can offer you. This is not an interesting fact for such an autonomous medium. Why doesn’t the shape adjust itself to the music?Since the digital age a shift has taken place within the way we consume music. Vinyl records and cassette tapes are exchanged for zero’s and ones; music literally has no physical shape anymore. The platforms on which music is being delivered to its audience have massively multiplied and even more importantly; renewed (think of thousands of professional and amateur music blogs and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat etc.). Never before has music taken on such a flexible form as it has done so now, since these new platforms and media have been accepted as a normal component of our current society and every day lives. Still, it seems to be the case that the new possibilities that have been created are not being used to it’s full potential. The static printed album cover has turned into the organic and ever-changing computer screen, but the album covers are still square (and not moving?). Artists seem to be falling in a routine when announcing a new record; an exciting message on Facebook, an interview at this blog; a mix for that blog; a show at that cool festival. With every artist mimicking the next when it comes to promoting themselves on these platforms, the only way of keeping the users attention is to break through the generic standards. What will the future of the way artists present themselves to their audience look like? And maybe even more important; how has it changed over the last couple of years? </div>
